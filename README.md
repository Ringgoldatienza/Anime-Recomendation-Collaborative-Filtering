Hi! I explored here the amazing things of what the recommenderLab R-package can do for collaborative filtering (recommendation system). I choose the anime dataset to create a recommendation system.

Documentation for the recommenderLab is available at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/recommenderlab/vignettes/recommenderlab.pdf
